### **High-Level Outline of the IRMAI Wireframe Prototype**
 
---
 
#### **A. Digital Twin Module (Foundational Contextual Layer for Compliance and Risk)**
   - **Purpose**: Acts as the **contextual foundation** across IRMAI, supplying centralized, real-time data and standards for all modules. It maintains a **knowledge graph-based model** of Tier 1 risks, controls, and standards, representing organizational structure and compliance requirements.
   - **Data Flows**: Feeds consistent taxonomies, standards, risk appetites, and escalation matrices to the Process Discovery, Risk Assessment, Controls Assessment, and Incident Management modules.
   - **Primary Screens**:
      - **Knowledge Graph Overview**: An interactive, AI-powered knowledge graph with expandable nodes displaying Tier 1 risks, controls, and standards interconnected for a complete contextual view.
      - **Standards Repository**: Left sidebar lists standards by category (regulatory, industry, internal), with a main view providing a hierarchical structure, metadata, and source details for compliance tracking.
   - **Validation Workflow**: Users can submit feedback on digital twin data, while senior management confirms updates to ensure **real-world compliance alignment**.

#### **B. Process Discovery and Mapping Module (AI-Powered Process Discovery Framework)**
   - **Purpose**: This module automates process mapping using real-time ERP transaction data to provide **operational resilience and compliance alignment** across mapped processes. It identifies process steps, bottlenecks, and standards conformance.
   - **Data Flows**: Uses standards from the digital twin for a compliance overlay on process maps; identified anomalies feed into the Risk and Controls Assessment modules.
   - **Primary Screens**:
      - **Process Map with Standards Overlay**: Dynamic flowchart showing mapped process steps with compliance status indicators (green for compliant, red for non-compliant). Filters allow views by geography, product, or department.
      - **Anomalies Dashboard**: Highlights flagged non-compliant areas in processes with a side panel for details and validation.
   - **Validation Workflow**: AI-identified anomalies are reviewed by users for initial validation, with final approval by senior management, supporting the **PRD’s continuous improvement** and compliance goals.

#### **C. Risk Assessment Module (Unified, Proactive Operational Risk Management Platform)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides **proactive risk detection and predictive analytics** for identifying risks at real-time and scheduled intervals, supporting the organization’s risk management policy and escalation paths.
   - **Data Flows**: Receives risk thresholds, appetite levels, and escalation matrices from the digital twin; flagged risks are routed to the Incident Management module for monitoring.
   - **Primary Screens**:
      - **Risk Overview Dashboard**: Real-time display of risk levels by category (e.g., high, medium, low), with **predictive analytics** to highlight escalating risks.
      - **Detailed Risk Assessment View**: AI-generated risk scores with drill-down options by risk category, aligned to the client’s risk thresholds and escalation paths.
   - **Escalation Workflow**: Automated escalation based on risk thresholds, notifying relevant teams when critical risk levels are reached.

#### **D. Controls Assessment Module (Continuous Compliance & Controls Monitoring for Multiple Frameworks)**
   - **Purpose**: Provides **continuous, multi-framework compliance monitoring** by automating control testing, evidence collection, and compliance alignment with standards across frameworks.
   - **Data Flows**: Draws control details and standards from the digital twin; control test outcomes and flagged failures route to Incident Management for follow-up.
   - **Primary Screens**:
      - **Control Health Dashboard**: Summary of control statuses with pass/fail indicators across frameworks like SOC 2, GDPR, and ISO 27001.
      - **Automated Testing Interface**: AI-generated test scripts, real-time evidence collection progress, and validation options for compliance results.
   - **Approval Workflow**: Control test results validated by users, with failed or adjusted controls escalated to senior managers for confirmation, ensuring **standardized reporting and continuous compliance**.
